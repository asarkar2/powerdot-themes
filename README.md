# powerdot-themes

These latex powerdot themes were created from themes of other popular latex slide makers mostly for my personal use. 
However, feel free to use them.

## Installation:
Copy the files to the following folder:

    # Linux
    $HOME/texmf/tex/latex/powerdot/contrib/
    
    # Windows
    C:\localtexmf\tex\latex\powerdot\contrib\
    # Make sure to add the path of C:\localtexmf to miktex path manager.

## Usage:

    # If you want to use the 'wj' theme, then
    \documentclass[style=wj]{powerdot}
